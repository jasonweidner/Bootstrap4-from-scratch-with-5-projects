# Description

This is the UI for an intermediately complex, multipage website theme. An example use case for these files is for the admin/management of a custom web app.

# Stack

HTML from scratch, Bootstrap4 for styling and icons from Font Awesome. There is a tiny bit of Javascript.

Bootstrap4 is accessed through a CDN. Bootsrap4 also uses JQuery, so JQuery is a dependency of this page.

Custom CSS styling was also used.

# Detail

The markup used in these pages showcase the use of:

- The grid
- Responsiveness and mobile-first design
- Default colors from Bootstrap
- Bootstrap components such as cards, accordions, data tables, pagination, and form formatting
- Icons from Font Awesome

# Reference

I created this page as part of a Udemy [course](https://www.udemy.com/bootstrap-4-from-scratch-with-5-projects/learn/v4/overview) with Brad Travery. I recommend the course for anyone curious about how to be more effective using a CSS framework like Bootstrap, or the role Sass plays in CSS-related workflows.
