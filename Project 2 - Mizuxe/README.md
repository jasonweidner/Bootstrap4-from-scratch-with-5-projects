# Description

This is the UI for a simple, one page website.

# Stack

HTML from scratch, Bootstrap4 and Sass for styling and icons from Font Awesome. There is a tiny bit of Javascript to animate some of the transitions from one id to another.

Bootstrap4 was downloaded, edited as Sass, and re-compiled using [Koala](http://koala-app.com/). That is why Bootstrap4 isn't accessed through a CDN. This approach allowed me to change the primary color easily.

Bootsrap4 also uses JQuery, so JQuery is a dependency of this page.

Custom CSS styling was also used. It was written in Sass and compiled to CSS using Koala.

# Detail

The markup used in this page showcases the use of the grid, responsiveness including media queries, mobile-first design, cards, and an accordion.

# Reference

I created this page as part of a Udemy [course](https://www.udemy.com/bootstrap-4-from-scratch-with-5-projects/learn/v4/overview) with Brad Travery. I recommend the course for anyone curious about how to be more effective using a CSS framework like Bootstrap, or the role Sass plays in CSS-related workflows.
